title: "Send User to Payment Page"
---

In this step you should send the user to the payment page by submiting a form on the client-side using the data you got back from the `requestPayment` method.

As mentioned in the previous page, the returned value contains the following:

- `url`: The url that you should send the form to
- `method`: Can be `GET` or `POST` depending on the driver
- `params`: An object that you should send with your form

You should create a form on the client-side, set its action to the `url`, its method to the `method` and add the `params` as input fields and submit the form.

:::tip
If you serve your pages from backend (not using a SPA), you can use the `getScript` method on `paymentInfo` and get a generate you a JS code that will automatically create and submit the form. Like so:

```js
res.send(
  `<html>
    <body>
        <h1> We're redirecting you to the payment gateway... </h1>
        <script>${paymentInfo.getScript()}</script>
    </body>
  </html>`
);
```
