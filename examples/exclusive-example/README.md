# Example using express.js and javascript

We have two routes in this example:

1. `/purchase` route, that will redirect the user to the gateway
2. `/callback` route, that will get the data from the service and verify it

To test using this example, you can use ngrok.com and add your ngrok url to the `.env` file.

This exmaple uses Zibal on `sandbox` mode.
