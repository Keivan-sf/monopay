You can add new drivers. just keep in mind that each driver has a `api.ts` file, containing the following:

1. The API to communicate with the IPG's API (containing requests and responses, errors and URLs)
2. The API for the package (driver-specific configuration and interface, like multiplexing)

Thanks for contributing.
